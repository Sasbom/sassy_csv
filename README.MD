# Sassy CSV
yeah, like, you know

CSV can be parsed so many ways and I wanted to see how well I could comply to the standard.
It's not that bad to do, it's mainly tedious, so my main goals are sensible file loading, 
ensuring field completeness, type inferrence with options for remaining loosey goosey with the numbers,
and also maybe generating some epic SQL code to inject stuff into some database with. That'd be neat.

Anyways, this is mainly just a toy. Don't use in production.
Other than that, 0 dependencies, code as simple as can be.
